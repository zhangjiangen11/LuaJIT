# LJRV - LuaJIT RISC-V 64 Port

LuaJIT is a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler for the Lua programming language,
RISC-V is a free and open ISA enabling a new era of processor innovation.

Development branch is avaliable at [plctlab/LuaJIT, branch riscv](https://github.com/plctlab/LuaJIT/tree/riscv).

**This is the release patch branch of LJRV, containing patchset based on LJRV dev branch commit [24636229e7ab ("riscv(interp): fix pcall ffunc w/o argument")](https://github.com/plctlab/LuaJIT/commit/24636229e7ab2daf7153adca829575dd65ad7e42), based off LuaJIT v2.1 rolling [19878ec05c23 ("Restore state when recording __concat metamethod throws OOM.")](https://github.com/LuaJIT/LuaJIT/commit/19878ec05c239ccaf5f3d17af27670a963e25b8b)**

## Introduction

LJRV is a ongoing porting project of LuaJIT to the RISC-V 64-bit architecture by PLCT Lab, ISCAS.
The ultimate goal is to provide a RISC-V 64 LuaJIT implementation and have it upstreamed to the official LuaJIT repository.

## Building and Packaging

LJRV is built and packaged in the same way as LuaJIT, requires a recent toolchain based on GCC or Clang with RISC-V 64 support and GNU Make.
For building and installation instructions, please refer to the [LuaJIT README](https://luajit.org/install.html).

For distro maintainers and packagers, we encourage one to follow our branch and patchset, as we would keep it up-to-date with the latest LuaJIT upstream. Cherry-picking and backporting is **strongly** discouraged, ["no matter how self-standing individual changes look (because they often are not)"](https://luajit.org/download.html).

## Progress

- [x] Interpreter Runtime
- [x] JIT Compiler

LJRV is still considered of beta quality, take it with a grain of salt.
For production usage, you might want to disable the JIT compiler during compilation by setting `XCFLAGS+= -DLUAJIT_DISABLE_JIT` in Makefile or environment variable.
